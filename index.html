        <h1>Inventory Made Simple</h1>
        <h3>Keep track of all your stuff</h3>

          <li><p>Inventory Made Simple is an app that will allow you to track inventory in your business, or at home. An example would be, a very disorganized person needs to find their book, however they forgot where they store their books. All they would need to do is a quick search in Inventory Made Simple.</p>
